# ForestCover-Type-Prediction
Can we predict the type of tree cover given cartographic data such as elevation, hydrologic, sunlight and soil data?</i> <b>This project attempts to predict the predominant type of tree in sections of wooded areas.

Understanding forest composition is a valuable aspect of managing the health and vitality of our wilderness areas. Classifying cover type can help further research regarding forest fire susceptibility and de/re-forestation concerns.

The data used in this report was taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data set consists of 15,120 samples of 30m x 30m patches of forest located in northern Coloradoâ€™s Roosevelt National Forest. . These areas represent forests with minimal human-caused disturbances, so forest covers are more a result of ecological processes than forest management practices.

The study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. We will be predicting an integer classification for the forest cover type. The seven types are:

1. Spruce/Fir
2. Lodgepole Pine  
3. Ponderosa Pine  
4. Cottonwood/Willow  
5. Aspen  
6. Douglas-fir  
7. Krummholz
